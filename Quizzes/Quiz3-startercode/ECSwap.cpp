// You are implement a function called ECSwap which takes two integers x and y and swap them if x is larger than y. Note: after the function returns, the passed integers should ensure x <= y
// The following code has a bug. Fix it

void ECSwap(int &x, int &y)
{
  if( x > y )
  {
    int tmp = x;
     x = y;
     y = tmp;
  }
}
